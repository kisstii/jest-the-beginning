# Jest the beginning

## Story

Testing is an important part of software development.
It takes time to write tests but it speeds up the long term development.

With a JS framework like React or Vue.js, one of the best tool for testing is `Jest`.

You need to write enough test to reach 100% coverage.

## What are you going to learn?

- Testing javascript code
- Mocking
- Coverage

## Tasks

1. Create proper tests for every function.
    - The coverage is 100%
    - Nothing depends on the environment (current time, network connection...)

2. [OPTIONAL] Visualize the code coverage
    - Jest is configured to generate an html report

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- Check out what type of coverage reports are supported out fo the box by jest. (Html)
